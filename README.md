ðŸ™‹ Hello, I'm Zullinira Dwi Utami :wave: . I am a graduate student of science from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) majoring in physics. Welcome to my portofolio :receipt:.

# Project : 
## âœ¨[1. Customer Segmentation ](https://github.com/Zullinira/Customer-Segmentation-)âœ¨
  - The aim of this project is to segment the Customers based on RFM using K-Means so that the company can target its customers efficiently
  - In addition, the project aims to provide recommendations for countries that are more eligible to receive aid donations
  - Using K-Means Clustering Unsupervised Learning
  
  ðŸ”¸**Input** : Dataset : [link dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jihyeseo/online-retail-data-set-from-uci-ml-repo)
  
  ðŸ”¸**Output :**
  - The most purchased product was 'Papercraft, Little Bride' but only 1 customer bought it.
  - Sales in August 2011 to November 2011 had a high rate of increase in sales.
  - 2D and 3D data visualization
  - There are 3 countries that are loyal customers, namely the UK, Australia, EIRE, and Nertherlands.
  - The distribution of customers is as follows :
