🙋 Hello, I'm Zullinira Dwi Utami :wave: . I am a graduate student of science from Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) majoring in physics. Welcome to my portofolio :receipt:.

# Project : 
# [1. Clustering the Countries by using K-Means ](https://github.com/Zullinira/Mini-Project-K-Means--Cluster-ML)
  - The aim of this project is to give consideration to using donations effectively and strategically
  - In addition, the project aims to provide recommendations for countries that are more eligible to receive aid donations
  - Using K-Means Clustering Unsupervised Learning
  
  ⭐**Input** : Dataset (.csv) [link download dataset](https://github.com/Zullinira/Mini-Project-K-Means--Cluster-ML/blob/main/Data_Negara_HELP.csv)
  
  ⭐**Output :**
  - Bivariate and univariate analysis
  - Data corellation 
  - 2D and 3D data visualization
  - Clustering countries (3D) using some important factors 
  - Clustering the coutries that are more eligible to receive aid donations from Help International

# [2. Titanic-Survival-Prediction](https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction)
  - The aim of this project is building a predictive model that shows people were more likely to survive in Titanic Tragedy
  - Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Supervised Learning (Decition Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearset Neighbors (K-NN))
  
  ⭐**Input** : 
  - Dataset Train (.csv) [link download dataset](https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/main/train1.csv)
  - Dataset Test to apply model (.csv) [link download dataset](https://github.com/Zullinira/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/blob/main/test.csv)
  
  ⭐**Output :**
  - Predict Model how will survive in Titanic Tragedy
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) has a higher accuracy than other algorithms
  
# [3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Hotel Data Analysis](https://github.com/Zullinira/EDA-for-Hotel-Data-Analysis)
  - This project is a mini project from Intermediate Bootcamp that be held for 4 weeks.
  - This project using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques 
  - The aim of this project is to analyse the available rooms
  
 ⭐**Input** : Dataset (.csv) [link download dataset](https://github.com/Zullinira/EDA-for-Hotel-Data-Analysis/blob/main/airbnb.csv)
  
 ⭐**Output :**
  - Cleaning the dataset
  - Visualize the price to compare the price of available rooms
